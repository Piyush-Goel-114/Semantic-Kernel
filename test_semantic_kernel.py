Could you provide your best pricing with any bulk discounts? We need delivery within 2-3 weeks.\n\nBob: Hi Alex, I can offer staplers at ‚Çπ100 each, books at ‚Çπ200 each, and pens at ‚Çπ10 each, totaling ‚Çπ37,920. Given the bulk quantity, Ill provide a 5 percent discount bringing your total to ‚Çπ36,024. Let me know your preferred delivery timeline and I can arrange within 10-15 business days.\n\nAlex: Thanks for the competitive pricing Bob. I need to know the stapler brand, if books are spiral-bound, and can you send pen samples for quality check? Our office renovation is delayed, so could we push delivery to first week of July instead? Also, whats your warranty and return policy?\n\nBob: We supply Kangaro HP-45 staplers, spiral-bound A4 books with hard covers, and Ill courier 5 Pilot BP-S pen samples tomorrow. July 1st delivery works perfectly - morning or afternoon slot? We offer 30-day returns and on-site quality inspection for bulk orders. Shall I prepare a formal quotation?\n\nAlex: Perfect Bob! Id like to confirm the order: 120 Kangaro staplers (‚Çπ12,000), 120 spiral books (‚Çπ24,000), 192 Pilot pens (‚Çπ1,920), total ‚Çπ36,024 after 5 percent discount. Delivery July 1st morning slot to Global Solutions Inc., Gurgaon. Please prepare quotation with payment terms, include GST number 06AABCS1234F1Z0, and arrange on-site inspection.\n\nBob: Excellent Alex!
